          <h2 class="about-heading">ABOUT SIKKIM </h2>
          <p class="about-content">Sikkim is a landlocked hill station in the Himalayan terrain. The state borders Nepal
            to the East,
            China's Tibet Autonomous Region to the North and East and Bhutan to the Southeast, while the state
            of West Bengal lies to the South. Sikkim was a British protectorate, before merging with Indian
            union following a referendum in 1975. With around 7,00,000 populations as of 2017, it is the least
            populous state in the country. Sikkim is nonetheless geographically diverse due to its strategic
            location in Himalayas; the climate ranges from subtropical to high alpine; and Kanchenjunga, the
            world's third-highest peak, is located on Sikkim's border with Nepal. It proves itself to be a
            tourism hotspot owing to its culture, natural scenery, hill beauty and biodiversity.</p>

          <p class="speakerDetail"> <b>Dr. Priya Ranjan</b> (M’1997) graduated from IIT Kharagpur (EE, 1997, Est.:
            1954), West Bengal,
            India and earned M.S. (EE) and Ph.D. (ECE) degrees from the University of Maryland, College Park,
            USA (Est.: 1856) in 1999 and 2003, respectively. He was introduced to control theory by well-known and
            researchers including Prof. K.B. Dutta of EE-IITKGP, and to nonlinear dynamics by Prof. Soumitro Banerjee
            (
            Bhatanagar Awardee). To pursue his passion in discovering new ideas in control theory and applications,
            he joined the Center for Artificial Intelligence and Robotics (CAIR, Bangalore),
            a DRDO lab under the tutelage of Prof. M. Vidyasagar. To continue and expand his studies,
            in 1997 he moved to the Computer Aided Control Systems Engineering (CACSE) lab at the Institute
            for Systems Research (ISR) at the University of Maryland under the guidance of Prof. E.H.
            Abed where he would spend the next twelve years in Maryland in various capacities. There,
            his work was supported by leading government funding agencies including NSF and DARPA,
            apart from multiple grants from various branches of the US Department of Defense.
            His work in nonlinear analysis of networking protocols pursued a non-conventional narrative,
            where non-linearity is an intrinsic property of network technologies, and the system plays
            the role of protagonist. His work revealed fabulous interactions of system dynamics with delays,
            which are naturally present in remotely operated networked systems. These interactions generate
            a beautiful canvas of behaviours in infinite dimensions. He managed to discover a constant which
            is the current limit for global stability in the presence of arbitrary delays, work which
            proudly stands on the shoulders of research legends like Kelley, Sharkovsky, Mallet-Paret and Ivanov,
            to move towards more general and realistic engineering cases.
            His latest interest is in biological computation and oncological image processing.
            He has been helping biologists and pathologists by designing and implementing user
            interfaces friendly to their way of working and generating innovative results for
            the next generation of analysis for bio-professionals. He truly believes that a multi-way
            productive collaboration with biologists, public health professionals and clinical scientists
            with bio-informatics and bio-computational suite of tools will lead to the next knowledge
            revolution for humanity towards facilitation of better health services. He has received many
            large project awards from some of the most reputed agencies like National Science
            Foundation (NSF)-USA, DARPA (credited with leading development of the Internet)-USA,
            Delhi University, DBT, DST-RFBR, ICMR etc. He has authored more than fifty research articles in different
            international
            conferences around the world.

            <b>Abstract: </b>
            In this speech, we demonstrate the role of optimization techniques in
            Deep Learning using some simple examples. Under this renewed context
            of deep learning, basic notion of Gradient Descent algorithm will be
            demonstrated in the framework of largely smooth optimization for both
            constrained and unconstrained cases. Further, role of convexity in
            optimization will be highlighted and noisy version of Gradient
            Descent will be illustrated towards minimizing the error function
            which appears naturally in the course of Deep Learning. Primitive
            computational techniques and algorithmic implementations will also be
            hinted at. Some hands on example regarding these optimization schemes
            and their application to deep learning will be demonstrated.

              <b>Abstract: </b>
              The healthcare industry has been demanding cutting edge technologies since time immemorial.
              Medical hardware & software, medication, surgical procedures, and the quality of care
              available
              to patients even in recent time need further development. In this talk, we will examine how
              Blockchain Technology may play the role of game changer for the Medical profession. The
              technology most commonly associated with Bitcoin could actually transform how we manage
              electronic medical records (EMR). Blockchain based EMR has the potential to bring
              fundamental
              changes to the healthcare industry for good. Here, we will look at the pros as well as the
              cons
              of such implementations. We will dive into current research that is ongoing in this growing
              field, and try to predict future directions this research may take.

                    The Artificial Pancreas System (APS) is a technology in development to help people with type
                    1 diabetes (T1D), to automatically and continuously control their blood glucose level by
                    providing the substitute endocrine functionality of a healthy pancreas. To accomplish this
                    objective, a complex decision making process is involved in a highly uncertain dynamical
                    human metabolic system. This talk will explore the idea of creating mathematical model from
                    the physiological understanding of the glucose-insulin metabolism and further extending the
                    talk to the paradigm of control computation for making decision to infuse appropriate
                    insulin dosage for a varying and uncertain parameter conditions. The mathematical treatment
                    of the computational algorithm will be cut short and only the philosophies developed by the
                    authors will be discussed. The APS technology development is currently a challenging area of

                    India is a vast country with complex socio-economic characteristics that are reflected in
                    its medical systems. These include an insufficient number of primary care doctors practicing
                    in rural and semi-urban areas and consequently about 70% of the population that lives in
                    rural areas, in particular, has limited access to adequate health care. This is further
                    compounded by the fact that the out-of-pocket expenditure constitutes around 80% of the
                    total healthcare spending. This is a matter of grave concern as Health in India stands at a
                    paradoxical juncture. We believe that the use of Information and Communication Technologies
                    (ICT) for health (eHealth) has the potential to improve all these areas, that is facilitate
                    access to quality health care and to health information as well as improve the quality of
                    health-related data, as has been demonstrated in other Low and Middle Income countries. The
                    adoption of Intelligent Decision Support Systems based delivery of health-related services
                    not only involves remote clinical participation, that may enable the timely diagnosis to
                    enable suitable involve mobile communications technology, commonly known as mobile Health
                    (m-health) but also help in triaging patients in the order of urgency.

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Advances in wireless technologies have created lots of possibilities of newer applications. The
                    demand of miniaturization and integration of multiple functions in wireless systems is becoming
                    more
                    attractive for researchers and industries. Metamaterial antenna can address such issues. It is
                    very
                    important for wireless systems. It is used to have high gain, high directivity, and
                    miniaturization
                    in size with multi band and wide band capabilities.

                    During this presentation the focus will be on the recent trends of metamaterial antenna research.
                    Various topics will be discussed from basics to applications. Some of them are high gain and UWB
                    metamaterial antennas, reconfigurable and active metamaterial antennas, lens and MIMO metamaterial
                    antennas, wide-angle and polarization insensitive low RCS metamaterial antennas, metamaterial
                    based
                    circuits and applications. In addition to this some of our recent works on metamaterial antennas
                    and
                    absorbers will be discussed.

                    <b>Abstract: </b>
                    Epilepsy is a serious neurological disorder in which patients experience repeated unprovoked
                    seizures. It effects approximately 65 million people worldwide. Surgery and brain stimulation are
                    the last resort for patients who do not respond to medical treatments. Unfortunately, in around
                    40-60% cases surgery is not successful in rendering a patient seizure free as well as optimal
                    stimulation protocols are unclear. In this talk, I will discuss some of my work in which we
                    investigated the mechanisms underlying pathological brain function in epilepsy. I will describe
                    personalised models that simulate hallmark pathological activity featuring seizures. These models
                    when informed with patient-specific data enables performing virtual resections, thereby,
                    predicting
                    surgical outcomes patient-specifically. I will illustrate some of our results upon retrospective
                    application of these techniques on epileptic patients who underwent surgery. I will conclude by
                    demonstrating that computational techniques, such as modelling, and development of associated
                    mathematical theories offer a powerful approach to investigate brain function and dysfunction.
                    These
                    techniques are critical to investigate complex, multi-modal data we routinely acquire from the
                    brain. Such a framework can potentially lead to the formulation and validation of new hypotheses,
                    prediction of outcomes to a therapy, and novel patient-specific treatment strategies.

                    Evolutionary game theory with its ability to bridge the concepts from
                    biology, evolution, nonlinear dynamics, and game theory has been growing
                    as a tool which can be adopted to design and develop solutions for
                    problems in wireless networks and communication area. The mechanisms to

                    wireless networks which can be presented with this approach. How to device
                    the relations between evolutionary stable strategies and Nash equilibria
                    are considered. Concepts of using replicator dynamics in modeling the
                    problem shed light into the game. The analysis of example games is used to
                    illustrate the weaknesses and strengths of the theory.
